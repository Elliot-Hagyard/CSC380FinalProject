    "Sexism is a growing problem online. It can inflict harm on women who are targeted, make online spaces inaccessible and unwelcoming, and perpetuate social asymmetries and injustices. Automated tools are now widely deployed to find, and assess sexist content at scale but most only give classifications for generic, high-level categories, with no further explanation. Flagging what is sexist content and also explaining why it is sexist improves interpretability, trust and understanding of the decisions that automated tools use, empowering both users and moderators.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is based on SemEval 2023 - Task 10 - Explainable Detection of Online Sexism (EDOS). [Here](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/7124#learn_the_details-overview) you can find a detailed introduction to this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "You only need to complete **TASK A - Binary Sexism Detection: a two-class (or binary) classification where systems have to predict whether a post is sexist or not sexist**. To cut down training time, we only use a subset of the original dataset (5k out of 20k). The dataset can be found in the same folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "Different from our previous homework, this competition gives you great flexibility (and very few hints), you can determine: \n",
    "-  how to preprocess the input text (e.g., remove emoji, remove stopwords, text lemmatization and stemming, etc.);\n",
    "-  which method to use to encode text features (e.g., TF-IDF, N-grams, Word2vec, GloVe, Part-of-Speech (POS), etc.);\n",
    "-  which model to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "-  **Input**: the text for each instance.\n",
    "-  **Output**: the binary label for each instance.\n",
    "-  **Feature engineering**: use at least 2 different methods to extract features and encode text into numerical values.\n",
    "-  **Model selection**: implement with at least 3 different models and compare their performance.\n",
    "-  **Evaluation**: create a dataframe with rows indicating feature+model and columns indicating Precision, Accuracy and F1-score (using weighted average). Your results should have at least 6 rows (2 feature engineering methods x 3 models). Report best performance with (1) your feature engineering method, and (2) the model you choose. \n",
    "- **Format**: add explainations for each step (you can add markdown cells). At the end of the report, write a summary and answer the following questions: \n",
    "    - What preprocessing steps do you follow?\n",
    "    - How do you select the features from the inputs? \n",
    "    - Which model you use and what is the structure of your model?\n",
    "    - How do you train your model?\n",
    "    - What is the performance of your best model?\n",
    "    - What other models or feature engineering methods would you like to implement in the future?\n",
    "- **Two Rules**, violations will result in 0 points in the grade: \n",
    "    - Not allowed to use test set in the training: You CANNOT use any of the instances from test set in the training process. \n",
    "    - Not allowed to use code from generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance should be only evaluated on the test set (a total of 1086 instances). Please split original dataset into train set and test set. The test set should NEVER be used in the training process. The evaluation metric is a combination of precision, recall, and f1-score (use `classification_report` in sklearn). \n",
    "\n",
    "The total points are 10.0. Each team will compete with other teams in the class on their best performance. Points will be deducted if not following the requirements above.\n",
    "\n",
    "If ALL the requirements are met:\n",
    "- Top 25\\% teams: 10.0 points.\n",
    "- Top 25\\% - 50\\% teams: 8.5 points.\n",
    "- Top 50\\% - 75\\% teams: 7.0 points.\n",
    "- Top 75\\% - 100\\% teams: 6.0 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "Similar as homework, submit both a PDF and .ipynb version of the report. \n",
    "\n",
    "The report should include: (a)code, (b)outputs, (c)explainations for each step, and (d)summary (you can add markdown cells). \n",
